I am a postgraduate research student at the University of Leeds,
based in the [Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science][icas]

I research the fundamental fluid dynamics of storm systems, with
a particular emphasis on the convective systems of the West African
Monsoon and the effect that they have on their local environment.
