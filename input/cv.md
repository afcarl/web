Profile
-------

I am a PhD student at the University of Leeds, with an appetite for learning
new things. I use my training in physics to analyse systems in the Earth's
atmosphere. I enjoy solving new problems and am capable of significant
independent work.


Education
---------

*2010 - Present* **PhD Student, University of Leeds** 

*"The water cycle of West Africa: Dynamics of cumulonimbus storms"*, supervised by Doug Parker 
(Full NERC funding)

*2006 - 2010* **Physics, MPhys (2.i) University of Oxford**

Major options in Atmospheric/Oceanic and Condensed Matter Physics

Research
--------

I am investigating the impact that large storms have on their local
environment. I am using laboratory experiments, numerical modelling and
field data to investigate the role cold pools in the transmission of
energy away from the storm. Specifically, using a lock release tank and
high resolution stereoscopic PIV to analyse gravity currents in
homogeneous and two layer fluid and the UK Met Office Large Eddy Model to
perform idealised simulations in an atmospheric context.


Experience
----------

*2011* **Fennec field campaign**

Assisted with the construction and deployment of instrumentation in this large,
international consortium project.

*2010 - present* **Teaching**

I am a teaching assistant for 2nd year Meteorology and 1st year Physics
for Environmental Science. I also assist in undergraduate fieldtrips.

*2010* **NCAS Atmospheric measurement summer school 2010, Isle of Arran**

*2010* **Ewiem Nimdie Weather and Climate Forecasting in Africa summer school, KNUST, Ghana**

*2008* **Atmospheric Physics, University of Oxford**

6 week summer project in Peter Read's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics research
group, measuring barotropic jets in a rotating annulus.


Skills
------

I use GNU/Linux and make extensive use of Python, Vim, Git and Bash in my daily
workflow. I am familiar with the design, building and debugging of analog
electric circuits and the implementation of simple op-amp control systems. 

I have experience in the field deployment of a wide variety of meteorological
equipment and in the techniques of DGPS profiling. I have worked in both the
Arctic and the Sahara and have the competencies required to work in these
remote environments, solo or in a small team, for extended periods.

I have completed Mountain Leader training and am working towards assessment.


Activities
----------

I climb and mountain bike on a regular basis around Yorkshire and
the mountainous regions of the UK.
