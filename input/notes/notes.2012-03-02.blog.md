Meta-blogging
-------------
I'm starting to write things down as notes. There are numerous reasons
for this. Matt Might's blog on [academic blogging][] has a number of
reasons why academics should blog.

[academic blogging]: http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-blog-as-an-academic/

Most pertinent to me of these were 

+ **Blog as code repository**
  I'm starting to write more code, enough that I'm beginning to forget what
  I've written and what it does and for this to actually matter.
  This isn't so much of a problem with my big projects, rather
  the 20 line scripts that I write to automate some menial task.
  Posting my code would force me to factor clean code and to comment
  adequately, as well as potentially getting useful advice from other
  people.

+ **Blog as long-term memory**
  I read lots of things. I forget lots of things. I don't want to
  remember lots of things because that makes my head hurt. Blogging
  would act as a long term storage facility. The act of writing 
  something down gets it out of my head and allows other people
  to see potentially useful things that I've read about.

+ **Vented steam as post**
  Sometimes I get annoyed and would like to vent this somewhere. This
  would allow my grievances to at least disappear, be acted on or be 
  challenged.

However, probably the most important reason for writing is to *practice*
*writing*. At some point I'm supposed to submit up to 300,000 words as
a thesis. It would be nice not to have to do this in a month.

I saw a good documentary the other day about a Slovenian philosopher
called Zizek. Some people think he is a big deal. He says lots of
things, mostly interesting. One of those things was his advice on
writing. He said that he never 'writes'; rather, he makes lots of
notes and then he edits them.
