            <p>I'm starting to write things down as notes. There are numerous reasons
for this. Matt Might's blog on <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-blog-as-an-academic/">academic blogging</a> has a number of
reasons why academics should blog.</p>
<p>Most pertinent to me of these were </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Blog as code repository</strong>
  I'm starting to write more code, enough that I'm beginning to forget what
  I've written and what it does and for this to actually matter.
  This isn't so much of a problem with my big projects, rather
  the 20 line scripts that I write to automate some menial task.
  Posting my code would force me to factor clean code and to comment
  adequately, as well as potentially getting useful advice from other
  people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blog as long-term memory</strong>
  I read lots of things. I forget lots of things. I don't want to
  remember lots of things because that makes my head hurt. Blogging
  would act as a long term storage facility. The act of writing 
  something down gets it out of my head and allows other people
  to see potentially useful things that I've read about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vented steam as post</strong>
  Sometimes I get annoyed and would like to vent this somewhere. This
  would allow my grievances to at least disappear, be acted on or be 
  challenged.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, probably the most important reason for writing is to <em>practice</em>
<em>writing</em>. At some point I'm supposed to submit up to 300,000 words as
a thesis. It would be nice not to have to do this in a month.</p>
<p>I saw a good documentary the other day about a Slovenian philosopher
called Zizek. Some people think he is a big deal. He says lots of
things, mostly interesting. One of those things was his advice on
writing. He said that he never 'writes'; rather, he makes lots of
notes and then he edits them.</p>
